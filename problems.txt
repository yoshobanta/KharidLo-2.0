Removed the sales_history class variable from the Kharidlo class.
Added st.session_state.sales_history initialization in the Streamlit app setup section.
Modified the checkout method to append to st.session_state.sales_history instead of the class variable.
Updated the Admin Dashboard to read from st.session_state.sales_history instead of the class variable.
